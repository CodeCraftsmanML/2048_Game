2048 Game is a Python implementation of the classic 2048 game. The project is organized into three main directories, each serving a specific purpose to facilitate the game's development and execution:

Notebooks:

Logics.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the core logic of the 2048 game. It includes functions such as start_game, add_constant_2, transpose_matrix, reverse_matrix, move_left, move_right, move_up, and move_down. The notebook provides a detailed overview of the algorithms and logic used to manage game state, handle moves, and update the game board.
Script:

Logics.py: This file contains the updated logic of the game based on the functions described in Logics.ipynb. It encapsulates the game mechanics in a Python script for easy integration and execution.
2048.py: This script uses the Tkinter library to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the game. It handles frame management, layout, and user interaction, initializing the game and managing the game loop.
constants.py: This file defines various constants used throughout the project, such as the size of the grid, tile colors, background color, and key bindings for user controls.
venv:

requirements.txt: Contains a list of Python dependencies required to run the game. This file ensures that all necessary packages are installed in the virtual environment, facilitating easy setup and management of project dependencies.
The 2048 Game project features an interactive GUI and adheres to the original game's rules, with a clear separation of game logic, user interface, and configuration settings. The organization of the project allows for easy development, testing, and enhancement of the game.
